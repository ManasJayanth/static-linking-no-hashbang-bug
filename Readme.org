* Steps to reproduce

  1. Run =make=

  #+begin_src sh
  make 
  #+end_src

  (runs fine and displays the date)

  2. Remove the shebang line from =script.sh= and run make again

  #+begin_src sh
  make
  #+end_src

  (Fails with 127)

This issue isn't seen in non-static scenario

  #+begin_src sh
  ocamlopt -o hello unix.cmxa hello.ml
  chmod u+x script.sh
  ./hello ./script.sh # with shebang line works
  ./hello ./script.sh # without shebang works too
  #+end_src
